# SupplyChain

## 🌱 About SupplyChain

SupplyChain is a comprehensive AgriTech platform designed to revolutionize the agricultural supply chain by connecting farmers directly with buyers, reducing food waste, and optimizing logistics. Our platform addresses the $1 trillion global food waste problem while empowering small farmers with better market access and reducing post-harvest losses by up to 30%.

### Key Features

- **🚜 Farmer Onboarding**: Comprehensive crop planning, weather integration, and AI-powered yield prediction
- **🛒 Digital Marketplace**: Direct farmer-to-buyer connections with restaurants, retailers, and processors
- **🚚 Logistics Optimization**: Intelligent route planning, cold chain management, and real-time delivery tracking
- **✅ Quality Assurance**: Photo-based quality assessment with blockchain traceability
- **💰 Financial Services**: Integrated crop insurance, microfinance, and seamless payment processing

## 🏗️ Architecture

SupplyChain is built on a robust, scalable architecture designed for high performance and reliability:

- **Backend**: Django 4.2+ with Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 13+ with optimized indexing
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **API**: RESTful APIs with comprehensive documentation
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and performance optimization
- **Task Queue**: Celery for background processing and async operations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Redis 6+
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment configuration**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database and Redis configurations
   ```

5. **Database setup**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Load sample data (optional)**

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/supplychain

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# Security
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False

# External APIs
WEATHER_API_KEY=your-weather-api-key
PAYMENT_GATEWAY_KEY=your-payment-gateway-key
```

### Database Configuration

SupplyChain uses PostgreSQL with the following optimizations:
- Indexed foreign keys for fast joins
- Partitioned tables for large datasets
- Connection pooling for improved performance

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run tests with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
coverage html  # Generate HTML coverage report
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Setup

1. **Install production dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/production.txt
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.production
   export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
   ```

3. **Collect static files**
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```

4. **Run migrations**
